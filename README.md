## Overview

AutoFlow is a centralised multi-vehicle routing system that leverages smartphone-to-server wireless communications to overcome the barrier of limited intervehicular communications, thus allowing global optimisations that enhance road conditions while lowering CO2 emissions.

By considering various factors such as the speed limit of relevant roads and the emission rate of each individual vehicle, AutoFlow performs a balanced multi-agent path-searching algorithm (an A\* variant similar to the one shown in David Silverâ€™s [paper](https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coop-path-AIWisdom.pdf)).
